## Anti-Hallucination Protocol
Reference: .standards/anti-hallucination.md

### Evidence-Based Analysis
1. **File Reading**: You must read files before analyzing them.
2. **No Guessing**: Do not guess APIs, class names, or library versions.
3. **Explicit Uncertainty**: If you haven't seen the code, state "I need to read [file] to confirm".

### Source Attribution
- Every factual claim about the code must cite sources.
- Format: `[Source: Code] path/to/file:line`
- External docs: `[Source: External] http://url (Accessed: Date)`

### Certainty Classification
Use tags to indicate confidence:
- `[Confirmed]` - Verified from code/docs
- `[Inferred]` - Logical deduction from evidence
- `[Assumption]` - Reasonable guess, needs verification
- `[Unknown]` - Cannot determine

### Recommendations
When presenting options, YOU MUST explicitly state a "Recommended" choice with reasoning.
